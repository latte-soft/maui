## üéâ About

Maui is a powerful, yet user-friendly and efficient script/model bundler for Roblox, greatly enhancing script development with modularity and allowing use of popular tools such as [Rojo](https://rojo.space), [Wally](https://wally.run), [Roblox-TS](https://roblox-ts.com), and many more!

**It's very general purpose.** You could even have an external workflow using industry-standard tooling like Git and VSCode, or even just use vanilla Roblox Studio if that's your preference! If it's built down to a model, Maui can bundle it all into an executable script.

<details open>
<summary>üåü Basic Features</summary>
<br />
<ul>

* Bundling all scripts, classes, properties, attributes, and *any* scriptable Roblox DataTypes into one Lua/Luau script with [LuaEncode](https://github.com/regginator/LuaEncode)!
* Very simple and user friendly plugin UI.
* Extremely quick build times, with optimal output using an [rbxm](https://dom.rojo.space/binary)-like object structure for storage space, *and* runtime load speed optimizations.
* Clever global flattening in script closures, while still completely imitiating a normal individual script environment as expected.
* A very simple [runtime API](#the-maui-script-global).
* An easy, flexible [configuration format](#the-maui-project-format) for more advanced projects.

</ul>
</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

<details open>
<summary>(‚ú® RECOMMENDED) Roblox Marketplace</summary>
<br />
<ul>

You can purchase the plugin directly [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/12071720464). Remember, you *can* get the plugin for no cost directly from GitHub, but you are responsable for maintaining the build on your local machine. If you want to support us and recieve automatic updates on the plugin, you can use this option!

From there, just "Install" the plugin in Studio from Roblox like normal!

</ul>
</details>

<details closed>
<summary>Pre-Built Binaries from GitHub Releases</summary>
<br />
<ul>

Head over to the [latest release](https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/releases/lastest) page on the GitHub repository, and download whichever file suites best. ([`Maui.rbxm`](https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/releases/latest/download/Maui.rbxm) will load the quickest, and [`Maui.lua`](https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/releases/lastest/download/Maui.lua) is packed with Maui itself!)

If you don't know where your specific local plugins folder is, in Studio, goto the "Plugins" tab via the ribbon-bar, and on the left there should be a "Plugins Folder" button. Opening that will prompt open the local plugins folder, where you will be able to place the build in!

<summary>Building from Source</summary>
<br />
<ul>

We provide an automated build script using [Lune](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune), which you can run from the base directory of the repository with `lune build`. You need everything in [`aftman.toml`](aftman.toml) installed and accessable from your `$PATH`, preferably with [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).

The following instructions are just for building Maui as quickly as possible manually, in-case you can't use the Lune build script.

<sup><i>Keep in mind, you still need at least [Wally](https://wally.run) and [Rojo](https://rojo.space) installed to completely build the plugin.</i></sup>

* Clone the Repository

```txt
git clone https://github.com/latte-soft/maui.git && cd maui
```

* Install Packages w/ Wally

```txt
wally install
```

* Build Model w/ Rojo

```txt
rojo build -o Maui.rbxm
```

And you're done! You can place the built model file into your plugins folder

</ul>
</details>

## üöÄ Quick Start

<details open>
<summary>In a new/existing Studio place, go to the *"Plugins"* tab from the ribbon menu, and you'll see the plugin.</summary>
<br />
<ul>

<img width="190" src="assets/repo/usage/maui_in_plugins.png" alt="Maui in plugins tab" />

</ul>
</details>

To bundle a model/project, just select an object, and click "Build" in the plugin's GUI. Due to LuaEncode's efficiency and optimization, Maui usually only takes a few *milliseconds* to bundle the output.

After the script is built, Maui will open the output in Studio's script editor, and Maui will store information logs from the build process in its internal console. From there, you're done! You can run the bundled output in a script utility, another script in your game, use it with Lua obfuscation, and anything else you'd need. It's 100% portable, and will work in almost *any* Roblox Lua/Luau environment.

For configuring how the codegen behaves at runtime, check out the built-in [project format](#the-maui-project-format). Also, by default, if you provide a `ModuleScript` named "MainModule" at the root of the model at build time, Maui will return the value from it with the exact same behavior as requiring a module by ID on Roblox.

## The `maui` Script Global

In all Maui script closures, a "`maui`" global is pushed into the environment. You could use it in a script like so:

```lua
if maui then -- Then the script is running under Maui's environment!
    print("Running on Maui v" .. maui.Version .. "!")
end
```

Here's the *current* API reference:

```lua
maui = {
    Version: string,
    Script: LuaSourceContainer,
    Shared: {[any]: any}
}
```

* ### Get Version

  ```lua
  maui.Version: string
  ```

  Returns a constant of the version of Maui the script was built with.

* ### Get Real Script Object

  ```lua
  maui.Script: LuaSourceContainer
  ```

  Returns the *real* `script` global from the closure that's currently running.

* ### Get Shared Environment Table

  ```lua
  maui.Shared: {[any]: any}
  ```

  Returns a "shared" table for ALL closures in a Maui-generated script, so you don't need to the real `_G` or `shared`.

## The `.maui` Project Format

<sup><i>Keep in mind, this is mainly meant for more advanced projects/modules you're bundling. It is <b>not</b> necessary for using Maui.</i></sup>

You can place a module named ".maui" under the model you're building, and Maui will expect the return to be a table of options. Here's a Lua template for this:

```lua
return {
    FormatVersion = 1, -- Isn't necessary in the project file, but just for future proofing the format incase we ever change anything

    -- All output options
    Output = {
        Directory = script.Parent, -- A string/function/instance returning a specific output path in the DataModel
        ScriptName = "MauiGeneratedScript", -- The actual name of the output script object, e.g. "SomeScript"
        ScriptType = "LocalScript", -- Accepts "LocalScript", "Script", and "ModuleScript"

        MinifyObject = true, -- If the object table itself in the output is to be minified
    },

    -- "Flags" to be respected at runtime
    Flags = {
        ContextualExecution = true, -- If client/server context should be checked at runtime, and ignores LuaSourceContainer.Disabled (e.g. LocalScripts only run on the client, Scripts only run on the server when this is true)
        ReturnMainModule = true, -- **If applicable**, return the contents of a "MainModule" named ModuleScript from the root of the model. This behaves exactly like Roblox's MainModule system
    },

    -- Property wl/bl overrides
    Properties = {
        Whitelist = {}, -- [ClassName] = {PropertyName, ...}
        Blacklist = {}, --  ^^^
    }
}
```

You can *also* use [Rojo's JSON module feature](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/sync-details/#json-modules) (if you're using Rojo) to store this module in JSON, which would obviously be a file named ".maui.json":

```json
{
    "FormatVersion": 1,

    "Output": {
        "Directory": "return script.Parent",
        "ScriptName": "MauiGeneratedScript",
        "ScriptType": "LocalScript",

        "MinifyTable": false,
        "UseMinifiedLoader": true
    },

    "Flags": {
        "ContextualExecution": false,
        "ReturnMainModule": true
    },

    "Properties": {
        "Whitelist": {},
        "Blacklist": {}
    }
}
```

Still keep in mind, you need to include this file in your `*.project.json` file, if you're using Rojo.

## ü§ù Contributing

*For now*, there really aren't any specific contribution instructions to follow. We're still working on our public Luau style-guide, so if you have an idea/implementation of something, show us your idea through an [issue](https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/issues) or [pull-request](https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/pulls)!
