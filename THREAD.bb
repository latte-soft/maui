[size=x-small][i]You can skip reading this if you want to..[/i][/size]
[size=x-large][b]Preface[/b][/size]
Ever since the very simple beginnings of script development on this platform, we've all followed a fairly similar, basic way of writing and distributing scripts as a whole. We've had minor changes over the years with things like more complex obfuscation and auth systems, but for the most part, it's still quite the same overall; write everything in one script, and distribute. For tools/libraries made by script devs, this often isn't very organized, or [i]secure[/i] for that matter.

There have been fairly [i]similar[/i] solutions to these issues in the past like [url=https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1162252]"luapack"[/url] and [url=https://github.com/richie0866/rbxm-suite]"rbxm-suite"[/url], however, they usually only solved part of a problem, and either worked against the Roblox environment, or were just too impractical/had too many issues in production.

While the previous way of doing things is not necessarily [i]bad[/i], and can actually be quite useful for small/simple projects, it's not always efficent for proper code organization or development in general. These days, we also have MANY awesome, professional tools created by Roblox's OSS community like [url=https://rojo.space]Rojo[/url] and [url=https://wally.run]Wally[/url] [size=xx-small]sorry, wally[/size], and even libraries such as [url=https://github.com/Roblox/roact]React[/url], [url=https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion]Fusion[/url], and [url=https://github.com/evaera/roblox-lua-promise]Promise[/url].

[size=small][i]Please read [b]this[/b], though[/i][/size]
[size=x-large][b]Also..[/b][/size]
[b]The first thing you may be wondering if you clicked on the [i]"Get it on Roblox"[/i] button before reading this[/b] is probably something along the lines of [b]"Why is this a paid plugin?"[/b]. Well, it [i]is[/i] and it [i]isn't[/i]. Let me explain.

The plugin, and [b]all[/b] of its source code, will [b]always[/b] be 100% free (as-in freedom) & open source, under the GNU LGPLv3 License. You can download & build from source on the [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui]GitHub repository[/url] (if you're worried about security or whatnot), or install a pre-built version directly from the [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/releases]releases page[/url]. We [i]also[/i] provide the plugin on Roblox's Developer Marketplace for ~250 Robux, if you want to support us, or just want automatic updates. With a self/pre-built version of the plugin, you're responsible for keeping it up-to-date in your plugins folder.

[hr]

[size=x-large][b]Ok.. So What [i]is[/i] Maui?[/b][/size]
Put short, Maui is the full idea of Roblox model/object serialization [b]and[/b] script packing put together. This allows script developers to use any of the tooling or libraries they wish! You could use a workflow with [url=https://code.visualstudio.com/]VSCode[/url], [url=https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman]Aftman[/url], [url=https://rojo.space]Rojo[/url], [url=https://wally.run]Wally[/url], [url=https://roblox-ts.com]Roblox-TS[/url], [url=https://github.com/Roblox/tarmac]Tarmac[/url], [url=https://darklua.com]Darklua[/url], etc.. Or just good ol' Roblox Studio! If it's built down to a Roblox model, you can build it into a script with Maui.

It's very general purpose, and will pack almost any model you throw at it. Any class, any property, any attribute, and [i]any[/i] Lua DataType. As long as it's configured properly in the API dump and is a Lua-accessable DataType, it'll build!

Maui is built with [url=https://github.com/regginator/LuaEncode]LuaEncode[/url], another general-purpose project of mine that was a direct component of this. It will handle [b]any[/b] Lua/Roblox-Lua DataType, and even supports vanilla Lua 5.1! If it weren't for making LuaEncode, Maui wouldn't be possible.

[size=x-large][b]Why the Name?[/b][/size]
The name of this project was originally going to be "Eclipse", however, it turned out to be a [i]very[/i] generic and overused name, used by multiple other Lua (Roblox) projects. ("Lua" means "Moon", yeah..) [url=https://luau-lang.org]Roblox's built-in scripting language[/url] is named "Luau", which is a type of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C5%AB%CA%BBau]traditional party/feast[/url] in Hawaiian culture. [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau]"Maui"[/url] is one of the largest islands in Hawaii, with [url=https://mauiluau.com]Luau parties throughout the year[/url]. Hence, a non-generic name!

[size=x-large][b]Installation & Getting Started[/b][/size]

[spoiler="Installation via Roblox Marketplace"]
You can purchase the plugin directly [url=https://www.roblox.com/library/12071720464]here[/url]. Remember, you [i]can[/i] get the plugin for free directly from GitHub, but you are responsable for maintaining the build on your local machine.

From there, just "Install" the plugin in Studio from Roblox!
[/spoiler]

[spoiler="Installation via GitHub Releases"]
Goto the [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/releases/lastest]latest release[/url] on the GitHub repository, and download whichever file suites best. ([font=Courier]*.rbxm[/font] is faster to load, and [font=Courier]*.rbxmx[/font] is more readable.)

Do note, pre-built versions of Maui are always minified with [url=https://darklua.com]Darklua[/url], a Lua formatter. It is [b]not[/b] obfuscation, just minification.

If you don't know where your specific local-plugins folder is, in Studio, goto the "Plugins" tab via the ribbon-bar, and on the left there should be a "Plugins Folder" button, opening that will prompt the local plugins folder, where you will place the plugin in.

[spoiler="Building from Source"]
For building directly from source, you can view the latest build instructions in the [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui#installation]repository's README.md[/url].
[/spoiler]



[size=large][b]Usage[/b][/size]
In a new/existing Studio place, go to the [i]"Plugins"[/i] tab from the ribbon-menu, and you'll see a button similar to this:

[img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1060751075415687178/1060815232076873728/image.png[/img]

Upon toggle, you should automatically see the widget, which from there has more instructions in the console! It is [i]always[/i] completely synced with [b]your[/b] Studio's color palette theme, with Fusion components similar to Studio's look & feel.

[img=420x259]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1060751075415687178/1060817600243830845/image.png[/img]

From there, just select an object, and click "Build"! Due to LuaEncode's EXTREMELY fast speeds and optimization, Maui usually only takes a few [i]milliseconds[/i] to create the output.

After the script is built, Maui should open the output script's editor window, and Maui will store information logs in the internal console.

From there, you're done! You can run it in a script utility, another script, place it into obfuscation, etc.. It's 100% portable, and will work in almost [i]any[/i] Roblox environment!

[size=small][i]This is a simple test-script for using Fusion with an exploit, you can see the source [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/blob/main/tests/HelloFusion]here[/url]![/i][/size]

[size=x-large][b]The [font=Courier].maui[/font] Project Format[/b][/size]
[size=small][i]This is really meant for more advanced projects/modules you're packing, and right now there really isn't much outside of minification options.[/i][/size]

You can place a module named ".maui" under the model you're building, and Maui will expect the return to be a table of options. Here's a Lua template for this:

[code]return {
    FormatVersion = 1, -- Isn't necessary in the project file, but just for future proofing the format incase we ever change anything
    -- All output options
    Output = {
        MinifyTable = true, -- If the codegen table itself (made from LuaEncode) is to be minified
        UseMinifiedLoader" = true -- Use the pre-minified LoadModule script in the codegen, which is always predefined and not useful for debugging
    }
}[/code]

You can [i]also[/i] use [url=https://rojo.space/docs/v7/sync-details/#json-modules]Rojo's JSON module feature[/url] (if you're using Rojo) to store this module in JSON, which would obviously be a file named ".maui.json":

[code]{
    "FormatVersion": 1,
    "Output": {
        "MinifyTable": true,
        "UseMinifiedLoader": true
    }
}[/code]

Still keep in mind, you need to include this file in your [font=Courier]*.project.json[/font] file, if you're using Rojo.

[hr]

[size=x-large][b]Contributing[/b][/size]
[i]For now[/i], there really isn't any specific contribution instructions to follow. We're still working on our public Luau style-guide, so if you have an idea/implementation of something, show us your idea through an [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/issues]issue[/url] or [url=https://github.com/latte-soft/maui/pulls]pull-request[/url]!
